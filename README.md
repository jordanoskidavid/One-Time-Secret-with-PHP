Secret Sharing PHP App - README
Secret Sharing App

Welcome to the Secret Sharing PHP App COPY that I made in my Backend Developer Intern in GrabIT! This application allows users to securely store secrets and generate links that can only be viewed once. It's a great way to share sensitive information without leaving a permanent trace.

Features
Secure Storage: Secrets are stored using encryption to ensure their confidentiality.
One-Time View: Generated links can only be viewed once, adding an extra layer of security.
Automatic Expiry: Links automatically expire after being viewed or after a one week period.
User-Friendly: Simple and intuitive interface for both creating and viewing secrets.

Requirements
PHP 7.2 or higher
Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
MySQL database

Usage
Creating a Secret
Open the app in your web browser.
Enter your secret.
Click on the "Create New Secret" button.
Click "Generate Link." or Click "Generate random password"
Copy the generated link and share it with the intended recipient.
Viewing a Secret
Open the shared link in a web browser.
The secret or random generated password will be displayed on the page.
Once the page is closed, the secret is automatically deleted, ensuring one-time viewing.
Security
The Secret Sharing PHP App takes security seriously. Secrets are encrypted before being stored in the database, and links are designed for one-time use. However, no system is entirely immune to vulnerabilities.
